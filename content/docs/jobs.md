The `jobs` section configures how Soulsolid handles background tasks. These jobs are stored in runtime and their logs are persisted in files under a specified location. The default location for these logs is `./logs/jobs`.

Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
jobs:
  log: true
  log_path: ./logs/jobs
  webhooks:
    enabled: true
    job_types:
      - directory_import
      - download_album
    command: | # ntfy
      curl -d "Backup successful 😀" ntfy.sh/mytopic
```

- **log**: Enable or disable job logging.
- **log_path**: The directory where job logs are stored.
- **webhooks**: Configuration for sending notifications about job status.
  - **enabled**: Enable or disable webhooks.
  - **job_types**: List of job type strings to trigger notifications for. Use `"*"` to match all types.
  - **command**: Shell command executed via `/bin/sh -c` when a matching job finishes. Runs asynchronously with a 30-second timeout. Supports Go template syntax with these variables: `{{.Name}}`, `{{.Type}}`, `{{.Status}}`, `{{.Message}}`, `{{.Duration}}`.

## Job Scheduling

Only one job runs at a time. Additional jobs are queued and start automatically when the current job finishes.

## Job Types
